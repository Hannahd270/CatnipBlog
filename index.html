			<p>All kids have their favorite toys. When I brought Usagi into my family, I introduced her to a few toys. I wanted her to also experience catnip and have that boost of joy that every cat gets when it first comes out of that package. After several different toys, Usagi would fall back on her favorite toys that were non catnip. I then went on a search to find  different catnip options that would allow Usagi to still experience catnip along with her favorite non catnip toys.
</p>
				<p>I came across a catnip that can spray on her toys and it does not leave stains on anything. Another win, is that I don’t have to worry about cleaning loose catnip around my house from leaking toys. I was able to find an article that supported the features I was looking for,<a href="https://www.cuteness.com/13777399/best-catnip-sprays">cuteness.com</a>.</p>
				<p>After doing some research on catnip I found out if consumed by humans it can have a negative effects,<a href="https://sleepbaby.org/baby-ate-catnip/">sleepybaby.org</a>. Quite often my little sister comes over to visit and like most kids everything ends up in their mouth. Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to consume the spray sets my mind at ease and allows for a much more fun play date.</p>
				<p>Since getting the spray, Usagi is able to have more fun with her favorite toys. Having a family slumber party with my little sister and Usagi are much more enjoyable without the worry of possible loose catnip being out. The spray has also allowed Usagi to be more engaged with her scratching post than my furniture. Having this not only allows new fun memories, but it also allows Usagi to be introduced to new cat toys and accessories by just a couple catnip sprays.
